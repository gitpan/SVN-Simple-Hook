NAME
    SVN::Simple::Hook - Simple Moose-based framework for Subversion hooks

VERSION
    version 0.110071

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This is a collection of Moose::Roles that help you implement Subversion
    repository hooks by providing simple attribute access to relevant parts
    of the Subversion API. This is a work in progress and the interface is
    extremely unstable at the moment. You have been warned!

ATTRIBUTES
  repos_path
    Directory containing the Subversion repository.

SEE ALSO
    See SVN::Simple::Hook::PreCommit for an example. This role exists solely
    to be composed into other roles.
